## Install
 This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
    
    Pandas
    Numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    geopy
    folium
 ###### Geopy is a Python 2 and 3 client for several popular geocoding web services. Geocoding is the process to identify geographic coordinates like latitude and longitude of a given city/country/address. This is very useful during marking position on the map in data visualization. We use geopy.exec, geocodertimedout, geolocators, geopy.geocoder in the below code to fetch the results.
###### Folium is built on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js (JavaScript) library. Simply, manipulate   your data in Python, then visualize it on a leaflet map via Folium. Folium makes it easy to visualize data that’s been manipulated in Python, on an interactive Leaflet map. This library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox. 
## Pre-requisite :

     Python
     Machine learning techniques
     Data visualization.
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook or you could work on a cloud platform like google colab just like i have done.
